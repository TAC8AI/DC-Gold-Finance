# Used to calculate control-adjusted returns

self_storage:
  name: "Self-Storage Development"
  description: "Ground-up self-storage development as control investment benchmark"

  returns:
    irr: 0.18  # 18% IRR target
    cash_on_cash_year1: 0.08
    stabilized_yield: 0.12

  timeline:
    development_months: 18
    lease_up_months: 12
    total_to_stabilization: 30  # 2.5 years
    hold_period_years: 5

  risk_profile:
    volatility: "low"
    control_level: "high"
    liquidity: "moderate"
    leverage_typical: 0.65  # 65% LTV

  advantages:
    - "Direct operational control"
    - "Predictable cash flows"
    - "Lower correlation to markets"
    - "Tangible asset"
    - "Recession-resistant demand"

  disadvantages:
    - "Capital intensive"
    - "Local market dependent"
    - "Management burden"
    - "Limited upside vs mining"

# Control factor adjustments for mining investments
# Lower factor = project has more favorable characteristics
control_factors:
  base: 0.25  # Default for pre-production miners

  adjustments:
    permitted: -0.05      # Reduce risk if permitted
    financed: -0.05       # Reduce if fully financed
    producing: -0.10      # Significantly lower for producers
    early_stage: +0.05    # Increase for exploration
    high_jurisdiction_risk: +0.10  # Non-tier-1 countries
    proven_management: -0.03  # Track record bonus

  bounds:
    minimum: 0.10  # Even best miners have some control discount
    maximum: 0.50  # Very early stage, high risk projects

# Control-adjusted return calculation
# Mining Adjusted Return = Mining Expected Return - (Control Factor * Benchmark IRR)
# Example: 40% expected - (0.25 * 18%) = 40% - 4.5% = 35.5% adjusted return

# Hurdle rates for investment decisions
hurdle_rates:
  minimum_adjusted_return: 0.15  # 15% after control adjustment
  minimum_raw_return: 0.25       # 25% raw expected return
  maximum_acceptable_risk_score: 2.0  # Don't invest if risk > 2.0
